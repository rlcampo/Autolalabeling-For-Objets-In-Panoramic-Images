# Automatic-Object-Labeling-Method-in-Panoramic-Images
## Project Overview
Our method for automatically labeling objects in panoramic images leverages advanced computer vision techniques to classify objects in urban and road environments. By minimizing human intervention, we streamline the image analysis process, making it more efficient and scalable. This project is built using PyTorch, a powerful open-source machine learning library, enabling us to implement state-of-the-art models and achieve high accuracy in object detection and classification tasks.
